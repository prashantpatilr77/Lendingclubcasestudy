-Exploratory Data Analysis
-Identification of Risk and Opportunities based on various factors.
-If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

## Conclusions
- It has been observed that California, New York, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and Texas contribute about a massive 50% of total applications with California and New York alone accounting for 25% compares to the rest of the States. Through this analysis, there are two possible outcomes with one outcome explaining the higher potential of these 6 States. It may also be inferred that there is a need to overhaul the business prospects in all the other States depending upon the domain knowledge.
- Customer with around 11% tends to pay the loan fully as compared to higher interest rate above 13% 
- Customers with Grade A are less likely to default on loan payments.
- Customers with a loan tenure of 60 months are more likely to default on loan payments.
- Customers with a loan purpose of Small Business are more likely to default as compared to other categories
- Customers with an annual income of 60K or above and loan amount of 15K or less, are less likely to default on loan payments
